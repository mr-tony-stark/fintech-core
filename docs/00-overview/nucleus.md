# Storo Nucleus

The **Storo nucleus** is the boring, strict, event-driven core of the platform.  
It orchestrates all money movement across rails (USDC/Algorand, Zimswitch/OPPWA, EFT, mobile money) while enforcing compliance, ledger discipline, and reconciliation.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The nucleus exists to:
- Provide a **single canonical model** for all transfers.  
- Keep rail-specific logic isolated in **gateways**.  
- Guarantee **double-entry correctness** via the ledger.  
- Ensure **compliance and reconciliation** are first-class, not bolted on.  
- Emit **domain events** so every change is observable and auditable.  

---

## üß© Components at a Glance

- **Canonical Transfer Service (CTS)** ‚Üí orchestrates transfer lifecycle, idempotency, emits events.  
- **Rail Gateways** ‚Üí adapters for each rail, strict spec validation, submit & emit rail outcomes.  
- **Ledger Service** ‚Üí double-entry postings, balances, statements.  
- **Compliance Screening** ‚Üí fast local allow/deny; pre-submit & delta re-screens.  
- **Directory & Routing** ‚Üí institutions, BINs, fees, settlement windows.  
- **Reconciliation & Returns** ‚Üí ingest statements, match transfers, manage returns/exceptions.  
- **Event Bus + Outbox** ‚Üí exactly-once event delivery; glue between services.  
- **Platform/Base** ‚Üí shared utilities (admin, time, IDs, error handling, migrations).  
- **Operator Console** ‚Üí human control surface for exceptions, flags, returns.

## ‚úÖ Non-Negotiables

- Strict validation at rail gateways (no malformed messages pass).  
- Exactly-once events (via outbox + idempotent consumers).  
- Double-entry always balanced.  
- Compliance pre-screen mandatory before submission.  
- Reconciliation nightly, exceptions reviewed before books close.  
- Operator console required for human resolution.  

---

## üìà SLOs

- API latency (P99, `POST /transfers`): ‚â§ 250 ms (excluding rail response).  
- Event publish lag (P99): ‚â§ 1 s.  
- Ledger posting latency (P99): ‚â§ 1 s after `settled`.  
- Reconciliation match rate: ‚â• 99.8% same day, 100% by T+1.  
- Idempotency collision rate: 0%.
